      Sample Collision Logic
  </h2>  
</a>

  Now comes the math portion because math is everywhere. With some slight manipulation of the One-Dimensional Newtonian formula and the Pythagorean formula, collisions and their corresponding angle/velocity responses make the game look very natural like an organic cow. Go ahead, throw a rock and see what happens. Yeah that's Physics and Mathematics but more on that in the future. On a two-dimensional plane, the formula was difficult to adapt to at first, but thanks to [Chris Course](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9Yp2yz6-pwhQuPlIDV_mjA) and the [elastic collision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elastic_collision) wikipedia, I was able to manipulate the formula on a two-dimensional plane while maintaining the integrity of the responding angles.

``` javascript
  const handleCollision = (player1, player2) => {
  let x1 = player1.coordX;
  let y1 = player1.coordY;

  let x2 = player2.coordX;
  let y2 = player2.coordY;

  let dx = x2 - x1;
  let dy = y2 - y1;

  let rotatedAngle = -Math.atan2(dy, dx);

  let u1 = oneDRotation({ x: player1.velocityX, y: player1.velocityY }, rotatedAngle);
  let u2 = oneDRotation({ x: player2.velocityX, y: player2.velocityY }, rotatedAngle);

  let v1 = { x: u2.x, y: u1.y };
  let v2 = { x: u1.x, y: u2.y };

  let finalVel1 = oneDRotation(v1, -rotatedAngle);
  let finalVel2 = oneDRotation(v2, -rotatedAngle);

  player1.velocityX = finalVel1.x;
  player1.velocityY = finalVel1.y;

  player2.velocityX = finalVel2.x;
  player2.velocityY = finalVel2.y;

  let xPow = Math.pow(player2.coordX - player1.coordX, 2);
  let yPow = Math.pow(player2.coordY - player1.coordY, 2);
  let distance = Math.sqrt(xPow + yPow);

};

const oneDRotation = (velocity, angle) => {
  const rotatedVelocities = {
      x: velocity.x * Math.cos(angle * (180/Math.PI)) - velocity.y * Math.sin(angle * (180/Math.PI)),
      y: velocity.x * Math.sin(angle * (180/Math.PI)) + velocity.y * Math.cos(angle * (180/Math.PI))
  };

  return rotatedVelocities;
}
```

      Sample Projectile Logic
  </h2>  
</a>

  Projectile logic was a tad bit easier as it was limited to only one of the four cardinal directions. By providing a velocity and lifecycle, the bullets were able to become recycled so players don't get a screen full of flying bullets...although that might be a difficulty in the future for the crazy folks. The colors correspond to the elements and depending on what element the player is on, they will only shoot that type of element.

```javascript 
      this.context.beginPath();
        this.context.rect(
          this.posX - (13/2),
          this.posY + 40,
          13,
          13
        );
        switch(this.element) {
          case 'Fire':
            this.context.fillStyle = 'red';
            break;
          case 'Earth':
            this.context.fillStyle = '#7B1803';
            break;
          case 'Lightning':
            this.context.fillStyle = '#F5EE10';
            break;
          case 'Water':
            this.context.fillStyle = 'blue';
            break;
        }
        this.context.fill();
        this.context.closePath();

        this.context.beginPath();
        this.context.arc(this.posX, this.posY + 52, 7, 0, Math.PI);
        this.context.fillStyle = 'white'
        this.context.fill();
        this.context.closePath();

        this.posY += this.velocity;
        this.lifeline -= 1;
